    Q) Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The main focus of the of the project was to implement a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for the Intelligent Agent to 
    follow to achieve its goal of finding the Treasure. The majority of code was provided, however the algorithm code for
    each epoch was to be created by the student.

    Q) Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Q) What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        ---------------------------------------------------------
        Computer scientists work to solve issues in an efficient and logical manner.
        This is in an attempt to push people and technology further by enhancing all
        aspects of life. This can range from industrial applications to daily applications.
        
        
        Q) How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        -------------------------------------------------------
        I try to approach each problem logically and completely. This
        requires me to ensure that I understand the problem being placed
        in front of me and then working through it step by step. In some
        cases we must create our own solutions to problems.
        
        
        Q) What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        I have a duty to code resposibly and take into consideration ethical/ moral consequences.
